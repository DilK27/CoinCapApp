# CoinCapApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.2.

## First step
Pull down the files and run `npm i`. This will install the dependencies. After installed, continue to the next section.
Also make sure Nodejs version is 12 LTS or above to have stable 'worker-thread' support. I ran into an error (Cannot find module 'worker_threads'
Error: Cannot find module 'worker_threads') that was running a old Nodejs version

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
